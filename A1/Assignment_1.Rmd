```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installing Packages Needed to Look for Data

We will be installing BiocManager and GEOmetadb in order to look for quality datasets

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
if (!requireNamespace("GEOmetadb", quietly = TRUE))
    BiocManager::install("GEOmetadb")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
